								<h2>The Preservation Project - Competition Trailer</h2>
								<p>I was challenged by the creator of a fan-project to a lil' competition where we'd both make trailers for the same project only using stock assets (visuals, music, etc.) This is what
								I came up with on my end.</p>

								<h2>Zelda - SpaceWorld '97 Restoration Trailer</h2>
								<p>This was a fun trailer that I put together in order to get some minor work for another fan-project (spoiler: it failed), but has remained a favorite amongst people
								in my circle. I captured all gameplay footage and edited everything. I also made the custom mix of "2Bad" by Michael Jackson for this.</p>

								<h2>cake's "Exploring a 20 year old Japanese Animal Crossing save file"</h2>
								<p>One of the earliest paid video editing projects I took on back in 2020, when I used to do highlights for Twitch streamers. After this, I was offered a position as his full-time
								editor, which I passed on at the time due to... I don't remember. I also designed the thumbnail.</p>

								<h2>Mock Final Fantasy VII Website (N64)</h2>
								<p>The goal of this website was to program and design a website that would be able to run on antiquated hardware, in this case the Nintendo 64DD (released 1999).<br><br>All assets here
								work perfectly on old hardware, unlike modern websites which older computers and devices refuse to load.</p>

								<h2>The Rawest Forest (Version 2)</h2>
								<p>This is the current version of my personal website, which I completely rebuilt from the ground up as I was getting tired of the old site design. Neither version is complete,
								but I think this site has a much better overall feel and shows my work better.</p>

								<h2>MOTHERBOUND</h2>
								<p>"MOTHERBOUND" was my attempt at designing an old school fansite based on late-90s/early-2000s web etiquette for a private project. I designed the site mostly 
								from the ground up back in 2023, though development on it stopped as the project tied to it was put on hold.</p>
								<br><br> 
								<p>Due to the nature of the project, I'm unable to provide a link to the site or any code.</p>

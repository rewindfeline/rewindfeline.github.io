								<h2>Earthbound 64 - April Fools 2024</h2>
								<p>Probably the first of my animations that I would consider "good" despite its flaws, the video was popular enough around the community to catch the attention and approval of series
								creator, Shigesato Itoi.<br><br>
								
								The design for the main villain, "The Masked Man", was an early design that I helped assist create with another artist.</p>

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - Butch and the Coupons</h2>
								<p>Based on a script me and my best friend/writing partner wrote back in 2022, I finally left a depressive slump and was able to animate this rather quickly.
								I think I can do better now, and I've been half-tempted to recreate this one.</p>

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - Open Sesame Dance!</h2>
								<p>Based on one of the most popular scenes from the original source material and heavily requested, I struggled a bit to figure out how to animate dancing before I got
								something I was satisfied down. I also began experimenting with expressions on the faces and particle effects.</p>

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - Piggy Guys</h2>

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - Outside the Sheriff's Office</h2>
								<p>Based on one of my favorite moments from the source material, I really wanted to experiment more with camera movement and FOV, alongside testing new compositing methods to achieve

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - Masked Man Fight</h2>
								<p>This animation was originally supposed to be made for April Fools 2025 until realizing it was too big in scope to finish in time. Instead of downscaling, I instead halted work for the time
								being. I'm still pretty happy with the direction its turning out, but I still need to get better at creating particles.

								<h2>Earthbound 64 - April Fools 2025</h2>
								<p>The culmination of the skills and techniques I learned through-out 2024, I put in my all to make something that looked convincing and could fool people (which it did!). I'm also generally
								just happy with how much closer it feels in replicating a game from this era.<br><br>
								
								This video is where I also taught myself 3D modeling, which you can see with the logo at the start and many of the environments found in the video.</p>

								<h2>MOTHER Remake - Entering Magicant</h2>
								<p>This is a remake of a scene from the 1989 Famicom RPG "MOTHER" remade in low-poly 3D. This was for a private project that is currently on hold, as is one of the few visual aspects
								created for it. I had initially invisioned this scene in my dreams all the way back in 2021 and am extremely happy I was able to create some close to what I had initially dreamed up.</p>

								<h2>Final Fantasy VII - Test Animation</h2>
								<p>This is a remake of a scene from the 1997 Playstation RPG "Final Fantasy VII", created as a small test animation for a much larger project. While the original game used 3D player models on
								flat images, I wanted to try and visualize what it would look like in full 3D by remaking part of my favorite scene in the game.<br><br>
								
								Also I just wanted to figure out how to make the models move alongside the truck without much effort, which I did! So, it was worth it!</p>
